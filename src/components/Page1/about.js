        I started developing in my second year of college, where I took the lead
        as the developer for our school project. My focus is on becoming a web
        developer, with a strong interest in full-stack development.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main focus these days is on creating responsive and dynamic websites.
        I strive to enhance user experience by implementing modern design
        principles and optimizing performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also watch tutorials and read documentation on various programming
        languages. Additionally, I am currently undertaking a comprehensive
        Full-Stack Web Developer course on Udemy, which covers HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, Node, React, PostgreSQL, Web3, and DApps.
      </p>

        When I'm not at the computer, I handle household chores and organize my
        things. I also enjoy doing home workouts and love going for jogs.
